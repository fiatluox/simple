> angular-colorpicker-framework:  A simple colorpicker framwork with Angular.js, Twitter Bootstrap and Font Awesome.

    ```
    Bootstrap CSS editor for picking colors made with AngularJS.
    The editor provides an instant (phone) preview and generates CSS code upon saving.
    ```

The idea is a simple framework with a view of Bootstrap on the left-hand side and the colors are entered on the right-hand side;  the colors are instantly rendered on the left and output as CSS upon saving.

> The initial version is for editing compiled Bootstrap LESS & my company app LESS styles. Replace the index.html 'bootstrap-451.css' file with your own app bootstrap files.
