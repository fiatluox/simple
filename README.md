# Simple

> A live style editor built with AngularJS using ngRepeat, ngStyle, ngClass + JSON to generate a CSS rule set. Use it out of the box for editing Bootstrap colors or as the base for larger live style editor projects.

<pre>
    Bootstrap CSS editor for picking colors made with AngularJS.
    The editor provides an instant preview of colors and generates a CSS rule set from JSON upon saving.
</pre>

The idea is a simple framework with a mobile view of Bootstrap on the right-hand side and colorpicker on the left-hand side. The colors are instantly rendered and output as a CSS rule set upon saving.
