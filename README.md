# Simple

> angular-colorpicker-framework:  A simple colorpicker framwork with Angular.js, Twitter Bootstrap and Font Awesome.

<pre>
    Bootstrap CSS editor for picking colors made with AngularJS.
    The editor provides an instant (phone) preview and generates CSS code upon saving.
</pre>

The idea is a simple framework with a view of Bootstrap on the left-hand side and the colors are entered on the right-hand side;  the colors are instantly rendered on the left and output as CSS upon saving.

> The initial version is for editing compiled Bootstrap LESS & my company app LESS styles. Replace the index.html 'bootstrap-451.css' file with your own app bootstrap files and/or edit HTML to be displayed in the phone.

# Ideas

<pre>
    Update framework, look & feel and styles for the basic bootstrap.min.css file
    Add tablet view toggle
    Add type to be editable (type, size, weight, etc)
    Add grid to be editable ie: col-{{device}}-{{size}}
    Add LESS components
</pre>
